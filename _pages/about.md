I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center working with Dr.[Yingye Zheng](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/zheng-yingye.html) and Dr.[Yingqi Zhao](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/zhao-yingqi.html). 
I finished my PhD in Statistics at Iowa State University under the supervision of Dr.[Xiongtao Dai](https://crossd.bitbucket.io/) and Dr.[Zhengyuan Zhu](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/people/zhengyuan-zhu).
Prior to my doctoral program, I earned my M.S. in Statistics from the University of Michigan after obtaining B.S. in Mathematics from Tsinghua University. 

My research interests include but are not limited to decision making and functional data analysis. 
Currently I am developing Neyman--Pearson classifiers under data-shift and/or sequential decision scheme, exploring its potential in various real-world applications such as multi-step diagnostic protocols, real-time mobile health monitoring, and cancer active surveillance.
It is fascinating to combine statistical frameworks with the latest developments in machine learning to tackle problems once intractable.
